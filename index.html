                    <i>Q: &emsp; If aliens landed on earth tomorrow and offered to take you home with them, would you go?</i>
                    <br><br>
                    A: &emsp; I volunteer!
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <i>Q: &emsp; What’s the most scary moment you’ve ever experienced?</i>
                    <br><br>
                    A: &emsp; After Covid, I traveled to Sri Lanka and booked a villa way up in the mountains. 
                    And it was supposed to be a awesome, luxurious spot. 
                </p>
                    <figure class="right">
                        <img src="media/SriLankaVillaView.jpeg" alt="SriLankaVillaView"/>
                        <figcaption>The view from the villa in the morning</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                    But when we rolled in super late at night, the roads were like pitch black, 
                    and we started getting major creepy vibes during the cab ride by the host's driver. 
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, we arrive at what we thought was this swanky villa, 
                    only to realize IT IS A PERSONAL HOUSE.
                    <br><br>
                    The hosts were actually really sweet. 
                    they couldn’t have been happier to see us because they hadn’t had any guests during Covid. 
                    So they welcomed us with hot tea and even cooked us dinner themselves, 
                    which was nice but kinda unexpected. 
                    <br><br>
                    With no way to leave except through the host's transport, because it's all dark and we are in the top of mountain.
                    We played it safe that night. NO showers. NO sleep. NO food. Just drink the water we’d brought. 
                    It felt like we gonne get killed by the "quirky" hosts that night (I'm sorry, they are nice actually).
                    <br><br>
                    But come morning, everything changed. 
                    <br><br>
                    The sun rising over those mountains was unreal. 
                    Suddenly, the whole place looked stunning, 
                    and we could finally relax and appreciate the view. 
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the extremly beautiful view that we can never forget, 
                    we decided to head out, 
                    leaving behind a cool but kinda spooky memory of our mountain adventure in Sri Lanka.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <i>Q: &emsp; If you could only eat one dessert for the rest of your life, what would it be?</i>
                    <br><br>A: &emsp; Kuih Talam Pandan. Terima kasih, Malaysia.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <i>Q: &emsp; What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten?</i>
                    <br><br>A: &emsp; NEVER ASSUME. I cannot tell how many times it saves me.

                    improvements in efficiency and productivity. One notable achievement was the development of the OCBC
                    Malaysia ELI Trade Automation Smart Process Robot, which automated trade reconciliation for over 50
                    trade parameters. This innovative solution drastically reduced the processing time per trade from
                    over 40 minutes to less than 1 minute.

                    <br><br>Additionally, I created and implemented original solutions
                    that automated the comparison processes for different products. By taking on the processing of
                    approximately 1500 trades daily, these solutions relieved my colleagues of their workload and
                    eliminated human oversight errors.

                    <br><br>Furthermore, I played a key role in migrating our on-premises systems onto Jenkins, a
                    powerful automation tool. As part of this migration, I implemented the PyTest framework, enabling
                    automated testing of Python scripts. This framework ensured a minimum of 80% code coverage, enhancing the
                    reliability and stability of our systems.

                    <br><br>In addition to these technical achievements, I also took on the responsibility of onboarding
                    numerous interns to our team. Through effective integration and seamless collaboration, I ensured
                    that the interns were able to contribute effectively to our projects, ultimately delivering
                    successful outcomes for the team.

                    <p>During my pursuit of a Master's degree in Financial Technology (FinTech) at NTU, I had the
                    opportunity to work on a series of impactful projects. One notable project involved equity price
                    analytics, where I developed a Pairs Trading strategy by programming buy and sell signals using
                    Simple and Exponential Moving Averages. I also updated coding structures to generate long-short
                    pairs of equities, enhancing my skills in data analysis and algorithmic trading.

                    <br><br>In another project focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), I tackled the issue of
                    online harassment by developing a model for toxic comment classification. By remodelling machine
                    learning methods, such as LSTM, I achieved better efficiency and accuracy compared to simpler models
                    like Logistic Regression. This project showcased my ability to apply advanced NLP techniques and
                    contribute to creating a safer online environment.

                    <br><br>Furthermore, I ventured into the realm of blockchain technology by designing a smart
                    contract using Solidity for car rental companies. This project aimed to streamline daily operations
                    and facilitate secure transactions within the industry, highlighting my capacity to integrate
                    innovative solutions into traditional sectors.

                    <br><br>Lastly, I explored human facial expression recognition by engineering models using PyTorch
                    and SKLearn. With a focus on deep learning techniques, I achieved a commendable accuracy of 76% in
                    identifying different facial expressions. This project demonstrated my proficiency in leveraging
                    state-of-the-art technologies to tackle complex challenges.

                    <br><br>Through these projects, I not only acquired technical expertise but also honed my analytical
                    and problem-solving skills. The experiences gained during my time at NTU have equipped me with a

                    opportunities to uplift and empower others. Recognizing the disparity in access to educational
                    resources, they took it upon themselves to prepare coding lectures and programs specifically
                    tailored for less-privileged children.

                    <br><br>With great enthusiasm, they taught Python lessons to these young learners, igniting their
                    curiosity and fostering a love for programming. Through interactive activities like "Guess the
                    Number," they not only nurtured technical skills but also instilled confidence and encouraged
                    teamwork. By bridging the digital divide and empowering these children, this individual became a
                    catalyst for change, opening doors to opportunities that were once out of reach.

                    <br><br>Their tireless dedication to education and community outreach is a testament to their strong
                    sense of social responsibility. By investing their time, knowledge, and compassion, they empowered
                    future generations with the tools to thrive in an increasingly digital world. Their impact reached
                    far beyond academic achievements, leaving a lasting legacy of inspiration, resilience, and
                    compassion.

                    <p></p>At the age of 17, during my first year at UCL, I embarked on a cooking learning journey, driven
                    primarily by
                    the desire to save money.

                    <br><br>Then, I moved to Singapore, got the opportunity to join the NTUC Bread Making (Basic Bread) course, and I must say it was an 
                    incredible experience. The course details, available on this website https://www.ntuclearninghub.com/en-gb/-/course/bread-making-basic-bread. 
                    
                    <br><br>Cooking and baking also became a way to nourish myself, as I discovered the joy of creating wholesome
                    and delicious foods tailored to my own preferences. Through this experience, I developed a lifelong
                    passion for cooking and a sense of pride in my ability to create delicious delights.

                    <p>I have always been captivated by Japanese culture, and my love for it began in primary school when I
                    started watching Japanese anime.
                    <br><br>One of the first anime series I watched was Natsume's Book of Friends (夏目友人帳), which
                    introduced me to the enchanting world of Japanese storytelling. However, my all-time favorite anime
                    has to be Fullmetal Alchemist (鋼の錬金術師). The intricate plot, compelling characters, and
                    thought-provoking themes resonated deeply with me.
                    <br><br> I am captivated by the world of vocaloid music and the enchanting character of Hatsune
                    Miku. Miku's digital persona and her distinctive voice have become iconic in the realm of Japanese
                    pop culture.
                    <br><br>Inspired by my passion for Janese culture, I took it upon myself to learn Japanese, starting
                    with
                    self-study aided by YouTube. I dedicated my efforts to mastering the Japanese language and achieved
                    a commendable result by attaining the N2 level proficiency.
                    <br><br>Although I am proud of this accomplishment, I acknowledge that there is still room for
                    improvement, and I remain committed to further refining my Japanese skills in the future.

                    <br><br>Among my most memorable experiences are attending concerts by virtual singer Hatsune Miku
                    , rock band One Ok Rock and Radwimps. The energy, passion, and creativity that these performances exude are
                    truly captivating.
                    <br><br>In addition to Japanese artists, I have also had the privilege of attending concerts by
                    renowned Hong Kong singer Eason Chen and Miriam Yeung Chin-wah. Their soulful voice and heartfelt performances have left a
                    lasting impression on me. These concerts have not only allowed me to indulge in my passion for music

                    <br><br>It was an incredibly difficult period as I found myself gaining excessive weight, prompting
                    my doctor to recommend weight loss. However, I soon realized that traditional workouts felt like
                    torture to me. Despite this challenge, I persevered and embarked on a journey to find a balance
                    between nourishing my body and maintaining good health.
                    <br><br>Over time, I underwent significant changes in my mindset and began to appreciate and respect
                    my body instead of harboring feelings of self-hatred. I discovered a newfound love for weight
                    training, complemented by gentle cardio activities like swimming.
                    <br><br>Even while traveling, I found solace in working out as it helped alleviate fatigue and kept

                    <br><br>As a student at UCL in the UK, I often indulged in spontaneous solo trips, purchasing random
                    train tickets to explore different corners of the country.
                    <br><br>Singapore became a hub for memorable group travels with my friends, including visits to
                    captivating places such as Cambodia, Indonesia, UAE, and Sri Lanka.
                    <br><br>Among them, Sri Lanka holds a special place in my heart. Despite its reputation for danger,
                    I found it to be a haven of unparalleled beauty. The tranquil sea provided a healing experience,
                    while the enchanting tea factories offered a soothing ambiance. The people, predominantly Buddhist,
                    exuded kindness and generosity, leaving an indelible mark on my memery.
