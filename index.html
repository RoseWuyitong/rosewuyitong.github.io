                        <br><br>
                        A: &emsp; After Covid, I traveled to Sri Lanka and booked a villa way up in the mountains. 
                        And it was supposed to be an awesome, luxurious spot. 
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        But when we rolled in super late at night, the roads were like pitch black, 
                        and we started getting major creepy vibes during the cab ride by the host's driver. 
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, we arrived at what we thought was this swanky villa, 
                        only to realize IT IS A PERSONAL HOUSE.
                        <br><br>
                        The hosts were actually really sweet. 
                        they couldn’t have been happier to see us because they hadn’t had any guests during Covid. 
                        So they welcomed us with hot tea and even cooked us dinner themselves, 
                        which was nice but kinda unexpected. 
                        <br><br>
                        With no way to leave except through the host's transport, because it's all dark and we are in the top of mountain.
                        We played it safe that night. NO showers. NO sleep. NO food. Just drink the water we’d brought. 
                        It felt like we gonne get killed by the "quirky" hosts that night (I'm sorry, they are nice actually).
                        <br><br>
                        But come morning, everything changed. 
                        <br><br>
                        The sun rising over those mountains was unreal. 
                        Suddenly, the whole place looked stunning, 
                        and we could finally relax and appreciate the view. 
                        <br><br>
                        Despite the extremly beautiful view that we can never forget, 
                        we decided to head out, 
                        leaving behind a cool but kinda spooky memory of our mountain adventure in Sri Lanka.

                        <br><br><br><br>
                        <i>Q: &emsp; What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten?</i>
                        <br><br>A: &emsp; NEVER ASSUME. I cannot tell how many times it saves me.

                            I successfully spearheaded various projects at OCBC Malaysia, resulting in significant
                            improvements in efficiency and productivity. One notable achievement was the development of the OCBC
                            Malaysia ELI Trade Automation Smart Process Robot, which automated trade reconciliation for over 50
                            trade parameters. This innovative solution drastically reduced the processing time per trade from
                            over 40 minutes to less than 1 minute.

                            <br><br>Additionally, I created and implemented original solutions
                            that automated the comparison processes for different products. By taking on the processing of
                            approximately 1500 trades daily, these solutions relieved my colleagues of their workload and
                            eliminated human oversight errors.

                            <br><br>Furthermore, I played a key role in migrating our on-premises systems onto Jenkins, a
                            powerful automation tool. As part of this migration, I implemented the PyTest framework, enabling
                            automated testing of Python scripts. This framework ensured a minimum of 80% code coverage, enhancing the
                            reliability and stability of our systems.

                            <br><br>In addition to these technical achievements, I also took on the responsibility of onboarding
                            numerous interns to our team. Through effective integration and seamless collaboration, I ensured
                            that the interns were able to contribute effectively to our projects, ultimately delivering
                            successful outcomes for the team.

                            <br><br>By employing advanced analytics techniques, I assisted the management team in
                            implementing a new product structure. The clusters and labels generated through this analysis
                            identified the main target customers, enabling informed decisions on product offerings and marketing

                        <p>
                            During my pursuit of a Master's degree in Financial Technology (FinTech) at NTU, I had the
                            opportunity to work on a series of impactful projects. One notable project involved equity price
                            analytics, where I developed a Pairs Trading strategy by programming buy and sell signals using
                            Simple and Exponential Moving Averages. I also updated coding structures to generate long-short
                            pairs of equities, enhancing my skills in data analysis and algorithmic trading.

                            <br><br>In another project focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), I tackled the issue of
                            online harassment by developing a model for toxic comment classification. By remodelling machine
                            learning methods, such as LSTM, I achieved better efficiency and accuracy compared to simpler models
                            like Logistic Regression. This project showcased my ability to apply advanced NLP techniques and
                            contribute to creating a safer online environment.

                            <br><br>Furthermore, I ventured into the realm of blockchain technology by designing a smart
                            contract using Solidity for car rental companies. This project aimed to streamline daily operations
                            and facilitate secure transactions within the industry, highlighting my capacity to integrate
                            innovative solutions into traditional sectors.

                            <br><br>Lastly, I explored human facial expression recognition by engineering models using PyTorch
                            and SKLearn. With a focus on deep learning techniques, I achieved a commendable accuracy of 76% in
                            identifying different facial expressions. This project demonstrated my proficiency in leveraging
                            state-of-the-art technologies to tackle complex challenges.

                            <br><br>Through these projects, I not only acquired technical expertise but also honed my analytical
                            and problem-solving skills. The experiences gained during my time at NTU have equipped me with a
                            strong foundation in FinTech and have prepared me to make valuable contributions in this dynamic
                            field.

                            I have always been captivated by Japanese culture, and my love for it began in primary school when I
                            started watching Japanese anime.
                            <br><br>One of the first anime series I watched was Natsume's Book of Friends (夏目友人帳), which
                            introduced me to the enchanting world of Japanese storytelling. However, my all-time favorite anime
                            has to be Fullmetal Alchemist (鋼の錬金術師). The intricate plot, compelling characters, and
                            thought-provoking themes resonated deeply with me.
                            <br><br> I am captivated by the world of vocaloid music and the enchanting character of Hatsune
                            Miku. Miku's digital persona and her distinctive voice have become iconic in the realm of Japanese

                            <br><br>Over time, I underwent significant changes in my mindset and began to appreciate and respect
